# Learning Phaser : Farm Animals

This is the repository for the Farm Animals. To access the repository, click [here](https://github.com/LioNyde/LearningPhaser).

This game is created from the tutorials. The game/tutorial was originally written in phaser v2.50. I translated all the codes to phaser 3.
